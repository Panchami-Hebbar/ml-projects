            <h3>What is PCOS?ðŸ¤”</h3>
            <p>Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common health condition that affects women of reproductive age. 
                It happens when the ovaries produce too much of the male hormone called androgens. 
                This can cause problems with the menstrual cycle, making periods irregular or causing them to stop altogether. 
                Women with PCOS may also have trouble getting pregnant, experience weight gain, have acne, and see increased hair growth on their face and body. 
                Additionally, PCOS can lead to the development of small cysts (fluid-filled sacs) on the ovaries. 
                The exact cause of PCOS isn't known, but it's believed to be related to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. 
                Treatment often includes lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, and sometimes medication to manage symptoms.</p>
