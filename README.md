PCOS DETECTION WEBSITE
This project aims to develop a predictive model for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) 
utilizing machine learning techniques and a web-based interface to enhance accessibility and 
usability. The project encompasses data preprocessing, feature selection, model development, 
and deployment, ensuring a comprehensive approach to PCOS prediction.
In the data preprocessing phase, the dataset was meticulously cleaned by addressing missing 
values, removing irrelevant columns, and encoding categorical variables. The feature selection 
process employed the ANOVA F-value method, which identified the most significant features 
impacting PCOS diagnosis. This approach not only reduced dimensionality but also improved 
model performance by focusing on the most relevant predictors. A range of machine learning 
models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, KNearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, XGBoost, and CatBoost, were evaluated for their 
efficacy in classifying PCOS. The ensemble approach, specifically the blending ensemble 
method, was adopted to leverage the strengths of multiple models. This method combines the 
predictions of several base models to achieve improved accuracy and robustness. The blending 
model achieved an accuracy of 88.99%, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing prediction 
reliability compared to individual models
